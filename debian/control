Description: A tool to run clojure programs on the JVM, interactively and remotely.
Jark is a tool to run clojure code on the JVM, interactively and remotely. It has 2 components â€“ a client written in OCaml and a server written in Clojure/Java. The client is compiled to native code and is extremely tiny (~300KB). The client uses the nREPL protocol to transfer clojure data structures over the wire.
