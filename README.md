# jark

Jark is a tool to run clojure code on the JVM, interactively and remotely.
It has 2 components - a client written in OCaml and a server written in Clojure/Java. The client is compiled to native code and is extremely tiny (~300KB). 
The client uses the nREPL protocol to transfer clojure data structures over the wire. 

## BUILD

    opam switch 3.12.1
    opam install guts ocaml-nrepl-client ANSITerminal ledit-sexp
    cp dist/bin/jark-`uname`-`uname -m` PATH

### Server

    lein uberjar
